A wide-format, highly detailed, ultra-photorealistic image of a freshly prepared dish placed prominently in the center of a rustic wooden table. The dish is the clear focus, beautifully lit with soft natural light that enhances its color and texture. Surrounding it, in the background or off to the side, a few of the raw ingredients used in the recipe are arranged casually, slightly out of focus to keep the attention on the finished dish. The atmosphere is warm and natural, evoking the feeling of a cozy, artisanal kitchen.
